DriverBoost.exe is an executable file associated with the DriverBoost software developed by MaxPro Software Inc., typically found in the installation directory at C:\Program Files\driverboost. This program is designed to scan a computer's hardware and update drivers, which can enhance system performance and stability; however, its safety is often debated, as some users have reported that it may exhibit characteristics similar to adware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), leading to privacy concerns and system errors. While the software itself is not classified as a virus or malware by most antivirus programs, some security tools might flag it due to its behavior or the way it modifies system settings, prompting users to exercise caution and conduct thorough research or use trusted alternatives for driver management.
